									<h3>The PKA Philosophy:</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="row princ-info princ-info-phil">
									<p>The cornerstone of PKA’s business philosophy is quality, in terms of service and engineering design and documentation.  Our commitment to excellence is demonstrated by PKA’s development of structural designs through thorough and careful technical analyses; the establishment of design schedules and management of manpower to achieve them; the production of drawings and specifications through teamwork and coordination with the other disciplines involved; the production of complete, coordinated and properly detailed construction drawings and specifications; close communication with the client and, during construction, the contractor; and the prompt response to questions and requests for information.</p>

									<p>PKA is committed to teamwork on every project.  Our staff works with the owner, architect, civil, mechanical and electrical engineers, and the contractor or construction manager to develop overall project solutions that meet the owner’s needs, goals and desires.</p>

									<p>PKA is particularly attentive to the construction phase of projects.  PKA strives to provide prompt, responsive service in connection with requests for information, questions and field issues to help maintain construction schedules and progress.  One of our goals on every project is for construction to proceed as smoothly as possible.</p>

									<p>The results of our approach can be measured in the timely production of design documents, attainment of accurate construction bids and project budgets, and the smooth execution of construction.  The results are also reflected in the repeat business and referrals that PKA enjoys.  That the majority of our business comes from existing clients and their referrals is a source of great pride to us.</p>
